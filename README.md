## Life Expectancy Trends

- The worldwide average life expectancy has incresed from **66.8 years in 2007** to **71.6 years in 2022**, representing a **7.2% increase**.
- A noticable dip in the global life expectancy occurred in **2020** as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

- The following countries are tied for the highest life expectancy, at **89 years:** Sweden, Italy, Germany, France, Portugal, New Zealand, Finland, Norway, Spain, and Belgium.

## GDP vs. Life Expectancy

- There is a positive correlation: countries with **higher average GDP** tend to have **higher average life expectancy**.
- CASE analysis shows:
  
  - High GDP countries: higher count and life expectancy (\~stronger healthcare systems, better living conditions).
  - Low GDP countries: shorter life spans on average.

## Developed vs. Developing Countries

- Developed countries have higher average life expectancy.
- Developing countries comprise a larger number of countries but typically with lower life expectancy.
